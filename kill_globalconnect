# Kill the Palo Alto Networks Global Protect VPN software.
#
# This software can cause problems for some users because it keeps
# trying to connect, popping up dialog boxes, with no way to quit.
#
#   * The UI does not have any kind of "Quit" button or menu item.
#
#   * The macOS Activity Monitor can use "Quit" or "Force Quit",
#     and the command line process tools can use `kill` or `pkill`, 
#     but the software restarts when it's loaded into launchctl.
#
#   * The software is able to run simultaneously on multiple user
#     accounts on the same Mac; this is an atypical setup for a solo
#     user, but a typical setup for our teammates, who may have a user
#     account for normal work, and a separate user account for demos.
#
# This implementation uses `launchctl` to `unload the code,
# then kills the related processes.
